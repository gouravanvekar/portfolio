description:  Todo lists are notorious for collecting junk tasks that you want to remember but constantly re-prioritize. To solve the problem of todo list clutter, Blocitoff will manage your to-do lists by automatically deleting tasks that have not been completed after seven days. Our hypothesis is that if the task is not important enough to be completed within seven days, it does not belong on your to-do list.
